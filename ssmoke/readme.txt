This folder ('ssmoke/') contains all of the Python source code for this project.
It also serves as the highest-order directory for the Python modules to run in.
The modules are described as follows:
  - ssmoke2d simulates a 2-dimensional flow using the Schrodinger's Smoke algorithm.
  - ssmoke3d simulates a 3-dimensional flow using the Schrodinger's Smoke algorithm.
  - stam2d simulates a 2-dimensional flow using the Stable Fluids algorithm.
  - polytrope2d simulates a 2-dimensional flow using the Stable Fluids algorithm.
  - dataio provides an interface for reading/writing data from the above modules into numpy archives.
  - visualizer provides an interface for generating Matplotlib animations from the files generated by the dataio module.
  - common provides shared utility code.

Within this folder, the subfolders 'testcases/' and 'tests/' contain the test cases used in the report, and several internal unit tests, respectively.
All may be run via command line as:
    > python -m ssmoke.testcases.XXX
    > python -m ssmoke.tests.XXX
where XXX is the name of the relevant module (without the '.py' extension).
